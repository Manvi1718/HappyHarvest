# Welcome to Happy Harvest🌾

## Project Overview

Happy Harvest is a purpose-driven initiative aiming to combat food wastage at events and social gatherings. This project addresses the staggering issue of surplus food and redirects it to those in need through an innovative online platform.

## Problem Statement

In India, where 10 million weddings occur annually, the wastage of surplus food contributes to a loss of approximately US$14 billion. Happy Harvest seeks to mitigate this problem by creating an efficient solution for redirecting excess food to NGOs and orphanages.

## Project Highlights

In our mission to combat food wastage, we present impactful statistics: 70% of served food nourishes people, reducing waste to 30%. India's 2023 Global Hunger Index (GHI) score of 28.7, though serious, marks improvement.

Happy Harvest efficiently packages surplus food for NGOs and orphanages, ensuring food security. Connect with us through an efficient Contact Us form, fostering collaboration for a hunger-free future. Join us in making a lasting impact!
